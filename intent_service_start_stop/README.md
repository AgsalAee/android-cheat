# IntentService start stop

More interesting `IntentService` example.

Expected outcome:

- user clicks `start service`: the counter increases every 500ms
- user clicks `stop service`: the counter stops increasing
- user clicks `start service` again: the counter continues do increase, starting from the last state

So we have basically created a stopwatch.

User can start and stop service with buttons.
