# Location

This is basically a copy past of: <http://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html>

There are other methods, but the Google Play API is the one currently recommended. TODO: why? What does it have to do with Google Play?

This requires the `google-play-services`, which is annoying to install with `ant`, see: [android-command.md](android-command.md).
