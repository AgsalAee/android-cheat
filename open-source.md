# Open source

How open source Android really is? Would you be able to compile a decent phone entirely from source like you can for a desktop like Ubuntu?

Almost all Google apps are closed source: see this picture: <http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/exploring-the-world-of-foss-android-can-a-smartphone-be-open-source/>

Development is closed, and Google just releases source after the fact.
