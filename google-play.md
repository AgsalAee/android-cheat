Stock app distribution tool.

Close source server. Of course, like the rest.

## Alternatives

### F-Droid

FOSS server and hosts only FOSS software. Most popular alternative 2016.

TODO: why not installable from Play Store? Currently requires downloading APK.

### Amazon App Store

Looks like the main alternative to Google Play.

TODO: how to install? APK-only from Amazon web store? Why not from Google Play?

400k apps in 2015: <http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-appstore-nears-400k-apps-on-huge-progress/>

#### Amazon Underground

TODO: did it replace the Amazon App and the Amazon App Store apps?
