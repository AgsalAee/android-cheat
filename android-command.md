# Android command

Located under `$ANDROID_SDK/tools/android`.

## GUI

If you run just:

    android

you get a GUI to manage the installation of Android dependencies.

### Extras

As of Android 22, "Extras" are not included by default on the Java search path of the `build.xml` generated by:

    android create project [...]

This includes the `support` library, which is used on the default IDE Gradle template. Oh, such a lacking CLI-only support...

### support libraries on ant build

- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18525408/how-to-add-android-libraries-with-resources-without-using-eclipse>

Copy pasting the Jar from the SDK to under `lib/` works.

## create project

<http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-cmdline.html>

    android create project \
        --activity MyActivity \
        --name MyName \
        --package com.cirosantilli.android_cheat \
        --path . \
        --target 1

This template contains a `build.xml` which is used to configure the ant build system.

`--name` goes to `build.xml`.

    <project name="MyName" default="help">

`--package` says in which directory it will be installed. This seems to be the only think that determines which app is which. If you install a second app with the same package, it overrides the old one.

## gradle

To create a project with a `gradlew`  se `--gradle` and `--gradle-version` as mentioned at <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20801042/how-to-create-android-project-with-gradle-from-command-line>:

    android create project \
        --activity MyActivity \
        --gradle \
        --gradle-version 2.8 \
        --name MyName \
        --package com.cirosantilli.android_cheat \
        --path . \
        --target 1

TODO: how to build that project? Getting:

    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

    * What went wrong:
    A problem occurred configuring root project 'gradle'.
    > Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'.
       > Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.8.
         Required by:
             :gradle:unspecified

Looks like this template can be found under: `tools/templates/gradle`

## avd

Android Virtual Devices. Manage emulators.

If you have a real device, just use it instead. It is runs faster, and is more accurate, and the install time is not larger. Use emulators only for devices you don't own.

GUI:

    android avd

Allows to create and start emulators.
