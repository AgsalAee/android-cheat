# Gradle

Gradle commands for projects that have a `gradlew` file.

Those are created with Android Studio. TODO: how to generate that file from the command line?

Ant is another possibility, which is generated by `adb create project`.

The examples under `samples/` also use Gradle.

List Gradle tasks

    ./gradlew tasks
