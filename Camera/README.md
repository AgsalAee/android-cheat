Expected outcome:

- user clicks button
- a pre-made full-screen camera view shows up
- user clicks the camera button
- app goes back to the initial view, and shows a preview of the picture

Same technique seems discussed at: <http://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result.html>

Based on the super magic `android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE`.
