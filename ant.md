# ant

Contents of the `ant` generated by `android create project`.

Gradle, which is used by Android Studio, seems to be getting more support from Google, `ant` is likely to die.

## Most useful command

    ant clean && ant debug && ant installd

## Build

Build debug version of app:

    ant debug

Other versions:

    ant release
    ant instrument

TODO debug vs instrument?

## Install

Install the `debug` and `release` versions of the app:

    ant debug install
    ant release install

Requires that it has already been built before.

Or equivalently:

    ant installd
    ant installr

Specify device:

    ant -Dadb.device.arg='-s emulator-5554' installd

Uninstall:

    ant uninstall

## XML schema

This is a project ID:

    <project name="MyName">

Controls the name of the APKs generated under `bin/`. TODO: any other effect?

Changing this and reinstalling does not lead to multiple app installs.
