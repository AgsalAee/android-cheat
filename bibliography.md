## Samples

Official:

-   <https://github.com/googlesamples?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=android>, present under `<sdk>/samples/android-XX` and <http://developer.android.com/samples/index.html>

    - `BasicMediaDecoder`: click play to show an `.mp4` H.264 / AAC video decoded on screen. The timing is horrible, with lots of breaks. And when the short video ends, an exception is raised.

Third-party:
